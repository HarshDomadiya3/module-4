# What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java
Class:-
        A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that its objects will have.

Object:-
        An object is an instance of a class. Once a class is defined, objects can be created with specific data and behaviors.
          
Encapsulation:-
                Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, 
                and restricting access to some of the object's components.

Inheritance:-
                Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. It helps in code reusability and creating hierarchical relationships.

Polymorphism:-
                Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon, even though they share the same name.

Abstraction:-
                Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
                  
 supported in java:- No
